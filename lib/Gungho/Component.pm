=head1 NAME

Gungho::Component - Component Base Class For Gungho

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package MyComponent;
  use base qw(Gungho::Component);

  # in your conf
  ---
  components:
    - +MyComponent
    - Authentication::Basic

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Gungho::Component is yet another way to modify Gungho's behavior. It differs
from plugins in that it adds directly to Gungho's internals via subclassing.
Plugins are called from various hooks, but components can directly interfere
and/or add functionality to Gungho.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 inject_base($c)

Inject the component to Gungho. It also sets a flag in the features() hash
so that other components in the system can query Gungho if it supprots
a certain feature X

=head2 feature_name()

Returns the name of the feature that this component provides. By default
it's the package name with "Gungho::Component::" stripped out.
