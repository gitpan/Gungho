=head1 NAME

Gungho::Base::Class - Base For Classes That Won't Be Instantiated

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Gungho;
  use base qw(Gungho::Base::Class);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a silly module, here only because Gungho used to be instance-based
and yet change to class-only after realizing you can't have multiple instances
of, for example, POE based Gungho objects and/or Danga::Socket based objects.

You usually don't need to know about this module.
