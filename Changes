  [Plugin::Apoptosis]
  - Fix calling methods

0.09005_03 Thu Nov 29 2007 [rev 371]
  [General]
  - Implement a $c->shutdown, and Engnie/Provider/Handler->stop that will
    stop the entire system
  - Ahem, *do* index the Japanese documentation (but change the names)

  [Provider::Inline]
  * Backwards Incompatible Change *
    - Provider::Inline will no longer dispatch your requests merely by
      placing them in $p->requests. You need to call send_request() yourself

  [RobotRules]
  - Deprecate usage of "module: RobotoRules::Storage::XXXX". Now you don't
    have to type that much. Just say "module: XXXX". This will break your
    old code! Beware!

  [Apoptosis]
  - Call shutdown() instead of setting is_running

  [Tests]
  - Fix a few failing tests

0.09005_02 Tue Nov 27 2007 [rev 348]
  [General]
  - Tweak deps
  - Don't index Japanese documentation

    Seems like some YAML versions reads in the '---' in the beginning of the
    YAML document
  - Add Gungho::Base::mk_virtual_methods()
  - Fix a bunch of typos in Japanese docs

  [RobotRules::Storage]
  - Explicitly state methods that should be virtual methods.

0.09005_01 Mon Nov 26 2007 [rev 328]
  [General]
  - Migrate hooks to Event::Notify. This breaks the input parameter list.
    Now you receive the event name as the first argument
  - Add a TODO.pod

  [Engine::POE]
  - Implement a shutdown state.
  - Make it callable from stop()

  [Engine]
  - Refactor handle_response to Engine.pm

  [Throttle]
  - Changed send_request() to return 1 on success, 0 otherwise.

  [RobotRules]
  - DB_File storage now dies if the call to tie() fails

  [Log::Dispatch]
  - Clarify in document that log config should be specified with "config"
    key.
  - Backport changes from ja docs


0.09004 Mon Nov 12 2007 [rev 276]
  [General]
  - Fix bug in detecting provider/handler

0.09003 Mon Nov 12 2007 [rev 276]
  [General]
  - Refactor Gungho::Inline into Gungho::Provider::Inline and 
    Gungho::Handler::Inline.
  - Add support for coderefs in provider/handler config parameters
  - Release 0.09003

0.09003_04 Sun Nov 11 2007 [rev 271]
  [General]
  - Add $c->pushback_request. Don't use $c->provider->pushback_request anymore!
  - Add Gungho::Util
  - Add Gungho::Manual::FAQ

0.09003_03 Fri Nov 09 2007 [rev 258]
  [POE]
  - Note: Changes for POE engine contained in this release are relatively
    critical. If you were having problems before, you probably should check
    this release out.
  - Be smarter how dispatch() gets called. Now we do a more effective
    invocation of the dispatch state so that we don't waste cycles just
    trying to dispatch requests.
  - Allow "0" setting in keepalive.keep_alive. This is a very important
    parameter if you're using Gungho through a proxy. If you enable this
    while under a proxy, PoCo::Client::Keepalive will think that you should
    be using the cached connection to the proxy and so Gungho will lose all
    parallism.
  - Allow setting the number of PoCo::Client::HTTP to be spawned via
    client.spawn parameter. This is required if you're dealing with 
    relatively large amounts of URLs at once. Otherwise, PoCo::Client::HTTP
    will tend to jam up after a while.

0.09003_02 Thu Nov 08 2007 [rev 258]
  [Throttle]
  - Fix Throttling to delegate throttling decisions. This allows you to
    stack throttlers.
  - Update prerequisite for Data::Throttler::Memcached

0.09003_01 Thu Nov 08 2007 [rev 254]
  [General]
  - Upload blunder. I meant to upload this as 0.09002_01, but I forgot to
    rename the file. I don't wish for 0.09002 to be a general release, so
    heres' 0.09003_01 with no code changes.

0.09002_01 Thu Nov 08 2007 [rev 253]
  [General]
  - DNS will not be resolved by Gungho if you do one of the following:
    * specify dns => { disable => 1 } in your config
    * specify client => { proxy => ... } in your config (POE engine only)
    * specify HTTP_PROXY in the environment (POE engine only)

  [Tests]
  - Add more tests

0.09001 Fri Nov 02 2007 [rev 248]
  [General]
  - No code changes
  - Update to Module::Install 0.68

0.09000_01 Thu Oct 25 2007 [rev 217]
  [General]
  * Backwards Incompatible Change *
  - Gungho inheritance has been reimplemented. Components are now called
    before Gungho::Component::Core, so things work a bit more like normal
    inheritance.
  - Gungho now uses Class::C3::Componentised and does Gungho->load_components()
  - Previously, Gungho->setup was the only thing required to setup the
    framework, but from now both Gungho->bootstrap and Gungho->setup needs
    to be called
  - Private IP blocking has been factored out to Component::BlockPrivateIP.
    You no longer specify block_private_ip_address setting, but instead
    you load BlockPrivateIP in the component list. See the documentation
    for BlockPrivateIP POD
  - Refactor Gungho::Base and separate out Gungho:Base::Class

  [Engine]
  - Change Gungho::Engine::POE's default loop_delay to 1

  [Scraper]
  - Add new Scraper component, which allows you to use Web::Scraper from
    within Gungho

  [Log]
  - Fix calling syntax for Gungho::Log::*::setup

  [Tests]
  - A few bogus tests have been fixed
  - POD coverage now ignores RequestTimer

0.08016 Sun Oct 21 2007 [rev 206]
  [Tests]
  - Be more paranoid about testing.
    Much thanks to David Cantrell for his automated testing.

0.08015 Sat Oct 20 2007 [rev 200]
  [Plugins]
  - Deprecate Plugin::RequestTimer
  - Update RequestLog log format.

  [POE Engine]
  - Set default timeout to be 60

0.08014 Thu Oct 18 2007 [rev 194]
  [General]
  - Makefile.PL now tries harder to silece CPAN::Reporter warnings.
  - Update module dependencies.
  - Remove modules that have optional dependencies from t/01_load.t
  - Use Gungho::Request instead of HTTP::Request

  [Tests]
  - Add more component tests.

  [Cache]
  - Fix docs

  [RobotRules]
  - Fix RobotRules::Storage::Cache so that Cache modules with different
    API (i.e. delete vs remove) now work

0.08013 Sun Oct 14 2007 [rev 182]
  [RobotRules]
  - Add expiration configuration parameters so that ttl for each robot rules
    can be configured
  - Add get_pending_robots_txt() and push_pending_robots_txt(). Pending
    requests are now controled in the Storage::* classes
  - Fix calling API for Storage::Cache, so that it also works for Cache::Memcached::Managed
  - Fix a problem where RobotRules::Cache (which is distributed) couldn't
    figure out that a robots.txt request has been dispatched.

0.08012 Sun Oct 14 2007 [rev 175]
  [Log]
  - *Backwards Incompatible Change*
    - Gungho::Log has been totally redesigned the following methods are
      now deprecated. Calling $c->debug(...) and such still work, but
      log setup has been completely changed.
      is_debug() and friends still exist, but they have been deprecated,
      and always return false.
    - engine.send_request hook has been moved to *right* before the 
      request is sent
  - Introduce Gungho::Log::Dispatch. Gungho::Log has now been re-implemented
    as Gugho::Log::Simple.
  - Introduce Gungho::Plugin::RequestLog

0.08011 Wed Oct 10 2007 [rev 166]
  [RobotRules]
  - Fix problems with RobotRules::Storage::* not properly accepting
    configuration parameters.
  - RobotRules::Storage::* now accept a $c in the first argument

0.08010 Wed Oct 10 2007 [rev 158]
  - Accept Data::Throttler::Memcached as the throttling engine as well.

0.08009 Mon Oct 01 2007 [rev 157]
  - New Cache component! Now you can cache anything, anywhere in your app.

0.08008 Mon Oct 01 2007 [rev 155]
  [General]
  - Make sure that the URI object is one that has the host() method at
    various places
  - Make block_private_ip_address() to accept an URI object.

  [Tests]
  - Disable localhost tests, as there are environments where this doesn't
    work.

0.08007 Sat Sep 29 2007 [rev 149]
  [RobotRules]
  - Fix how parameters are passed
  - Fixed a problem where Gungho would go in an infinite loop, if robots.txt 
    didn't exist. 

0.08006 Fri Sep 28 2007 [rev 145]
  [General]
  - Fix double-setting the host header. Reported by Keiichi Okabe
  - Fix Gungho::Request->clone to actually clone the contents of notes()
  - Attempt to use DNS lookup result from previous request, if the
    request has been cloned.

0.08005 Mon Sep 03 2007 [rev 142]
  [General]
  - Add docs
  - Fix dependencies
  - Properly receive user_agent from config

  [POE Engine]
  - Make sure that client: agent: is respected. However, this is an exception
    in the POE engine. If you are using only one user agent, you should be
    using user_agent. Reported by Keiichi Okabe

  [Tests]
  - Added t/03_live/twitter.t, but twitter is currently responding with
    urls like balancer://twitter_cluster/statuses/update.json, so it will
    most likely fail anyway.

0.08004 Wed Jul 25 2007 [rev 130]
  [General]
  - Previously block_private_address was blocking all addreses.
    Fixed (Kazuho Oku)
  - Previously private addresses were only checked after a DNS resolution.
    Now given an address that contains IP addresses to begin with are
    also checked (Kazuho Oku)
  - Local addresses other than loopback (127.0.0.1) are also checked.

  [POE Engine]
  - Parameters can now be passed to PoCo::Client::DNS (Kazuho Oku)

  [Build]
  - Retooled the tests.
  - Fixed requires list.

0.08003 Mon May 28 2007 
  - *Backwards Incomptible Change*
    - 127.0.0.1 is now considered a private IP address, when 
      block_private_ip_address is in use (Kazuho Oku).
  - 192.160.*.* was being considered a private IP address instead of
    192.168.*.* (Kazuho Oku).
  - The handler wasn't properly called when DNS lookups failed (Kazuho Oku)
  - Fix t/03_live/perl.t to reflect recent API changes.

0.08002 Tue May 15 2007 [rev 111]
  - Some remaining pieces of code that were assuming Gungho to be an
    object failed to execute at Class::Accessor::Fast. Spotted by
    Keiichi Okabe.
  - Make sure to force robots.txt request to be query-less and fragment-less

0.08001 Tue May 15 2007 [rev 108]
  - No code change
  - Doc blunder
  - Hide HTTP::Response from PAUSE

0.08 Tue May 15 2007 [rev 107]
  - *API Incompatiblity*
    - Gungho::Inline->run()'s parameter list changed so that it can accept
      a config file name (or a hashref, like Gungho->run), and a second
      hashref that contains the code references.
    - Parameter ordering for Gungho::Inline's provider and handler has been
      changed so that it resembles that of regular providers and handlers
    - The old behavior for both of the above changes are still preserved
      if you specify the GUNGHO_INLINE_OLD_PARAMETER_LIST environment
      variable, or if you specify sub Gungho::Inline::OLD_PARAMETER_LIST { 1 }
  - Implement blocking of private DNS names from lookups. By default
    this is disabled. To enable, set block_private_ip_address
  - So that method names for POE events are clearly marked as such,
    all methods that are mapped to POE events in Engine::POE are now
    prefixed with _poe_* (including private methods)
  - Change the way components are invoked. Components are now invoked via
    maybe::next::method() chain, and if a component should want to stop
    processing somewhere in the chain, it should raise an exception
  - Add Gunghoe::Component::RobotRules
  - GUNGHO_DEBUG environment variable is now respeced
  - Don't throttle (again) a request if it has gone through DNS-resolution 
    path internally.

0.07 Tue May 08 2007 [rev 90]
