Changes
=======

0.08 Mon May 15 2007 
  - *API Incompatiblity*
    - Gungho::Inline->run()'s parameter list changed so that it can accept
      a config file name (or a hashref, like Gungho->run), and a second
      hashref that contains the code references.
    - Parameter ordering for Gungho::Inline's provider and handler has been
      changed so that it resembles that of regular providers and handlers
    - The old behavior for both of the above changes are still preserved
      if you specify the GUNGHO_INLINE_OLD_PARAMETER_LIST environment
      variable, or if you specify sub Gungho::Inline::OLD_PARAMETER_LIST { 1 }
  - Implement blocking of private DNS names from lookups. By default
    this is disabled. To enable, set block_private_ip_address
  - So that method names for POE events are clearly marked as such,
    all methods that are mapped to POE events in Engine::POE are now
    prefixed with _poe_* (including private methods)
  - Change the way components are invoked. Components are now invoked via
    maybe::next::method() chain, and if a component should want to stop
    processing somewhere in the chain, it should raise an exception
  - Add Gunghoe::Component::RobotRules
  - GUNGHO_DEBUG environment variable is now respeced
  - Don't throttle (again) a request if it has gone through DNS-resolution 
    path internally.

0.02_05 Wed Apr 11 2007 [rev. 41]
  - Provider::Simple wasn't exactly prepared for the new code path.

0.02_02 Wed Apr 11 2007
  - Add a gungho script
  - Add throttling. You can now throttle your requests by domain or
    simply by the number of requests in a specific amount of time.
    Providers are now expected to handle "pushback" of requests when
    a request has been throttled.
  - Internal change: Code path to send requests has changed from
    Gungho.pm doing the control to Provider doing the control

0.02_01 Tue Apr 10 2007
  - Add experimental component system
    >>> NOTE <<< This is still subject to change *widely*

    your requests via Basic authentication
  - Fix Gungho::Request->clone()
  - Gungho::Provider::Simple respects the is_running() flag

0.02 Mon Apr 09 2007
  - Fix stupid bug in Gungho::Request
