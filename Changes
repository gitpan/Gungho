All changes by Daisuke Maki unless otherwise noted.

0.08009 Mon Oct 01 2007 [rev 157]
  - New Cache component! Now you can cache anything, anywhere in your app.

0.08008 Mon Oct 01 2007 [rev 155]
  [General]
  - Make sure that the URI object is one that has the host() method at
    various places
  - Make block_private_ip_address() to accept an URI object.

  [Tests]
  - Disable localhost tests, as there are environments where this doesn't
    work.

0.08007 Sat Sep 29 2007 [rev 149]
  [RobotRules]
  - Fix how parameters are passed
  - Fixed a problem where Gungho would go in an infinite loop, if robots.txt 
    didn't exist. 

0.08006 Fri Sep 28 2007 [rev 145]
  [General]
  - Fix double-setting the host header. Reported by Keiichi Okabe
  - Fix Gungho::Request->clone to actually clone the contents of notes()
  - Attempt to use DNS lookup result from previous request, if the
    request has been cloned.

0.08005 Mon Sep 03 2007 [rev 142]
  [General]
  - Add docs
  - Fix dependencies
  - Properly receive user_agent from config

  [POE Engine]
  - Make sure that client: agent: is respected. However, this is an exception
    in the POE engine. If you are using only one user agent, you should be
    using user_agent. Reported by Keiichi Okabe

  [Tests]
  - Added t/03_live/twitter.t, but twitter is currently responding with
    urls like balancer://twitter_cluster/statuses/update.json, so it will
    most likely fail anyway.

0.08004 Wed Jul 25 2007 [rev 130]
  [General]
  - Previously block_private_address was blocking all addreses.
    Fixed (Kazuho Oku)
  - Previously private addresses were only checked after a DNS resolution.
    Now given an address that contains IP addresses to begin with are
    also checked (Kazuho Oku)
  - Local addresses other than loopback (127.0.0.1) are also checked.

  [POE Engine]
  - Parameters can now be passed to PoCo::Client::DNS (Kazuho Oku)

  [Build]
  - Retooled the tests.
  - Fixed requires list.

0.08003 Mon May 28 2007 
  - *Backwards Incomptible Change*
    - 127.0.0.1 is now considered a private IP address, when 
      block_private_ip_address is in use (Kazuho Oku).
  - 192.160.*.* was being considered a private IP address instead of
    192.168.*.* (Kazuho Oku).
  - The handler wasn't properly called when DNS lookups failed (Kazuho Oku)
  - Fix t/03_live/perl.t to reflect recent API changes.

0.08002 Tue May 15 2007 [rev 111]
  - Some remaining pieces of code that were assuming Gungho to be an
    object failed to execute at Class::Accessor::Fast. Spotted by
    Keiichi Okabe.
  - Make sure to force robots.txt request to be query-less and fragment-less

0.08001 Tue May 15 2007 [rev 108]
  - No code change
  - Doc blunder
  - Hide HTTP::Response from PAUSE

0.08 Tue May 15 2007 [rev 107]
  - *API Incompatiblity*
    - Gungho::Inline->run()'s parameter list changed so that it can accept
      a config file name (or a hashref, like Gungho->run), and a second
      hashref that contains the code references.
    - Parameter ordering for Gungho::Inline's provider and handler has been
      changed so that it resembles that of regular providers and handlers
    - The old behavior for both of the above changes are still preserved
      if you specify the GUNGHO_INLINE_OLD_PARAMETER_LIST environment
      variable, or if you specify sub Gungho::Inline::OLD_PARAMETER_LIST { 1 }
  - Implement blocking of private DNS names from lookups. By default
    this is disabled. To enable, set block_private_ip_address
  - So that method names for POE events are clearly marked as such,
    all methods that are mapped to POE events in Engine::POE are now
    prefixed with _poe_* (including private methods)
  - Change the way components are invoked. Components are now invoked via
    maybe::next::method() chain, and if a component should want to stop
    processing somewhere in the chain, it should raise an exception
  - Add Gunghoe::Component::RobotRules
  - GUNGHO_DEBUG environment variable is now respeced
  - Don't throttle (again) a request if it has gone through DNS-resolution 
    path internally.

0.07 Tue May 08 2007 [rev 90]

0.02_02 Wed Apr 11 2007
  - Add a gungho script
  - Add throttling. You can now throttle your requests by domain or
    simply by the number of requests in a specific amount of time.
    Providers are now expected to handle "pushback" of requests when
    a request has been throttled.
  - Internal change: Code path to send requests has changed from
    Gungho.pm doing the control to Provider doing the control

0.02_01 Tue Apr 10 2007
